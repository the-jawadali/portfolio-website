        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Motivated and Dedicated aspiring software engineer with a strong academic background in Applied Science and Core Maths, having completed a BTEC Level 3 National Extended Diploma. After discovering a passion for technology through a coding bootcamp and mentorship from my older brother in the industry, I have developed practical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, alongside various other programming languages and soft skills such as problem-solving. I also value teamwork and communication, essential skills for thriving in collaborative software development environments. I am eager to pursue an opportunity which would allow me to gain hands-on experience, enhance my skills, and grow into a role within the tech industry.
